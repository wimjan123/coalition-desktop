- **Batch Operations**: Group similar operations to reduce overhead

## Development Workflow Decisions

### UI Design Approach
**Decision**: Hybrid programmatic and visual design workflow
**Rationale**:
- **Designer Productivity**: UI Builder for layout and styling
- **Developer Control**: C# code for dynamic behavior and data binding
- **Version Control**: UXML/USS files track cleanly in Git
- **Iteration Speed**: Real-time preview and adjustment

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Automated performance testing with manual acceptance criteria
**Rationale**:
- **Performance Validation**: Automated FPS and latency measurement
- **Regression Prevention**: Catch performance degradation early
- **User Experience**: Manual testing ensures subjective quality
- **Platform Validation**: Test on actual Apple Silicon hardware
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated builds and basic smoke tests

### Build and Distribution
**Decision**: Standalone .app bundle with notarization for distribution
**Rationale**:
- **User Experience**: Native macOS installation and launch
- **Security Compliance**: Meet macOS Gatekeeper requirements
- **Distribution Flexibility**: Can be shared without App Store
- **Professional Appearance**: Proper application bundle structure
- **Performance**: Optimized builds for end-user hardware

## Risk Mitigation Strategies
