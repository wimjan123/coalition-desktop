# COALITION Desktop Shell - Vision & Design Philosophy

## Project Vision

The COALITION Desktop Shell is a satirical simulation of political campaign and government management interfaces. It parodies the complexity and chaos of political operations through a familiar desktop metaphor, creating an engaging and humorous experience that highlights the absurdity of modern political life.

## Design Philosophy

### Satirical Approach
- **Gentle Mockery**: Poke fun at political processes without targeting specific individuals

- **Discoverability**: Make political concepts accessible through interactive interfaces
- **Engagement**: Create compelling interactions that encourage exploration
- **Performance**: Ensure smooth, responsive interactions that don't break immersion

### Technical Philosophy
- **Performance First**: 60 FPS is non-negotiable for smooth window operations
- **Data-Driven**: Use JSON fixtures to enable easy content iteration
- **Modular Design**: Build reusable components for future expansion
- **Offline-First**: No network dependencies for reliable demonstration
