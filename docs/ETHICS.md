# Ethics and Content Guidelines

## Core Ethical Principles

### Respect for Human Dignity
The COALITION Desktop Shell is committed to creating satirical content that respects the fundamental dignity of all individuals, groups, and communities. Our satirical approach focuses on systems, processes, and archetypes rather than targeting specific real-world individuals or vulnerable populations.

### Educational Responsibility
As a satirical simulation of political processes, this project has a responsibility to contribute positively to political literacy and civic engagement rather than promoting cynicism, misinformation, or political disengagement.

### Inclusive Representation
Our fictional political world should reflect the diversity of democratic societies while avoiding harmful stereotypes, exclusionary language, or representation that marginalizes any group based on identity characteristics.
